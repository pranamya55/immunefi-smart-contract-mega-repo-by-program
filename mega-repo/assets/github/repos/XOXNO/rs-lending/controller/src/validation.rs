/// Validation module providing security checks and constraint enforcement.
///
/// This module implements critical validation logic to ensure protocol safety:
/// - Payment validation for deposits, repayments, and withdrawals
/// - Asset support verification through liquidity pool existence
/// - Amount validation to prevent zero-value operations
/// - Flash loan security checks including shard validation and reentrancy protection
/// - Endpoint validation for flash loan callbacks
///
/// # Security Framework
/// All validation functions serve as the first line of defense against:
/// - Invalid or malicious transactions
/// - Unsupported asset operations
/// - Flash loan exploit attempts
/// - Cross-shard security vulnerabilities
/// - Reentrancy attacks
///
/// # Validation Hierarchy
/// 1. **Asset-level**: Verify asset is supported and has active liquidity pool
/// 2. **Amount-level**: Ensure amounts are positive and non-zero
/// 3. **Operation-level**: Validate specific operation constraints
/// 4. **Security-level**: Check for flash loan exploits and reentrancy

    /// **Purpose**: First-line validation for all payment-based operations including
    /// deposits, repayments, borrowing, and withdrawals. Ensures both asset support
    /// and payment validity before processing.

    /// **How it works**:
    /// 1. Validates asset has an active liquidity pool (require_asset_supported)
    /// 2. Validates payment amount is greater than zero (require_amount_greater_than_zero)
    /// 3. Returns early if both checks pass, reverts if either fails
    ///
    /// **Security validations**:
    /// - **Asset support**: Prevents operations on unsupported or delisted assets
    /// - **Amount validation**: Prevents zero-value attacks and dust operations
    /// - **Pool existence**: Ensures asset has active lending/borrowing functionality
    ///
    /// **Protocol safety**:
    /// This function serves as a critical security gate for all financial operations.
    /// Without proper validation, the protocol could:
    /// - Process operations on unsupported assets leading to undefined behavior
    /// - Accept zero-amount operations that could be used for exploit attempts

    /// Validates the flash loan target is a smart contract on the same shard.

    /// same shard to prevent cross-shard timing attacks and maintain atomic transaction
    /// guarantees. Rejects EOA addresses early to save gas on obviously invalid calls.
    ///
    /// **How it works**:
    /// 1. Verifies the destination address is a smart contract (not an EOA)
    /// 2. Gets the destination contract's shard ID
    /// 3. Gets the current controller contract's shard ID
    /// 4. Compares shard IDs and reverts if different
    ///
    /// **Security rationale**:
    /// - **Smart contract check**: EOAs cannot execute callback logic or repay flash loans
    /// - **Atomic execution**: Flash loans must execute atomically within single shard
    /// - **Timing attack prevention**: Cross-shard calls introduce timing vulnerabilities
    /// - **State consistency**: Same-shard execution ensures consistent state access
    /// - **MEV protection**: Prevents cross-shard MEV extraction opportunities
    ///
    /// **Flash loan flow security**:
    /// ```
    /// 1. Controller initiates flash loan (same shard)
