/// Command specifying a Bitcoin output for a withdrawal operation.
///
/// This structure instructs operators on how to construct the Bitcoin transaction
/// output when processing a withdrawal. It currently contains a single output specifying the
/// destination and amount, along with the operator fee that will be deducted.
///
/// ## Fee Structure
///
/// The operator fee is deducted from the withdrawal amount before creating the Bitcoin
/// output. This means the user receives the net amount (withdrawal amount minus operator
/// fee) in their Bitcoin transaction, while the operator keeps the fee as compensation
/// for processing the withdrawal.
///
/// ## Future Enhancements
///
/// - **Batching**: Support for multiple outputs in a single withdrawal command to enable efficient
///   processing of multiple withdrawals in one Bitcoin transaction

/// Represents an operator's claim to unlock a deposit UTXO after successful withdrawal fulfillment.
///
/// This structure is created when a withdrawal fulfillment transaction is successfully validated.
/// It serves as proof that a valid frontpayment was made matching the assignment specifications,
/// and authorizes the assigned operator to claim the corresponding locked deposit funds through
/// the Bridge proof system.
///
/// The claim contains:
/// - The deposit index that identifies which locked UTXO can be claimed
/// - The operator index of the assigned operator who is authorized to claim
///
/// # Important Notes
///
/// - The `operator_idx` always refers to the **assigned operator** from the assignment entry, not
///   necessarily the party who made the actual frontpayment (since frontpayment identity is not
///   validated during transaction processing).
/// - This data is stored in the MohoState and emitted as an ASM log via `NewExportEntry`.
/// - The Bridge proof system consumes these entries to verify operators have correctly fulfilled
///   withdrawal obligations before allowing them to unlock deposit UTXOs.
