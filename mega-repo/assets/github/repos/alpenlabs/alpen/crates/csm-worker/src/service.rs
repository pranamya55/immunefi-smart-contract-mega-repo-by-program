/// CSM worker service that acts as a listener to ASM worker status updates.
///
/// This service monitors ASM worker and reacts to checkpoint logs emitted by the
/// checkpoint-v0 subprotocol. When ASM processes a checkpoint transaction, it emits
/// a `CheckpointUpdate` log which this service processes to update the client state.
///
/// The service follows the listener pattern - it passively observes ASM status updates
/// via the service framework's `StatusMonitorInput` without ASM being aware of it.
