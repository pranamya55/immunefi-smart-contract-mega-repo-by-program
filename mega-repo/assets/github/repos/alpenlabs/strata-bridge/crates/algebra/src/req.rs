//! Request-response abstraction for actor-based communication patterns.
//!
//! This module provides a generic [`Req`] type that encapsulates the common pattern
//! of sending a request with input data and receiving a response through a channel.
//! It's particularly useful in actor systems where you need to send a message and
//! wait for a response.

///
/// This type is useful for RPC-like patterns where you send some input data
/// and expect a single response back. It bundles the input with a channel
/// for receiving the response.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use algebra::req::Req;
///
/// // Create a request with input data
/// let (req, response_receiver) = Req::new("hello".to_string());
///
/// // In an actor or handler:
/// let input = req.input();
/// let output = format!("{input} world");
/// req.resolve(output);
///
/// // The original caller can await the response:
/// // let result = response_receiver.await.unwrap();
/// ```
