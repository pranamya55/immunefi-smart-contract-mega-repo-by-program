//! Generic state machine infrastructure for the bridge.

/// This struct is used by all state machines in the bridge system. It contains:

/// The type parameters ensure that each state machine can only emit duties and signals
/// that are appropriate for that state machine.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `D`: The duty type specific to this state machine
/// - `S`: The signal type specific to this state machine (must be convertible to [`Signal`])

/// Trait for all state machines in the bridge system.
///
/// This trait provides a uniform interface for processing events and emitting outputs.
/// Each state machine implementation specifies its own duty type, signal type, and event type
/// through associated types.
///
/// # Type Safety
///
/// The `OutgoingSignal` associated type is constrained to be convertible to [`Signal`],
/// ensuring that all signals can be unified when routing between state machines.
/// However, each state machine can only emit signals of its specific `OutgoingSignal` type,
/// preventing it from emitting signals it shouldn't be able to produce.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl StateMachine for DepositSM {
///     type Duty = DepositDuty;
///     type Config = Arc<DepositSMCfg>;
///     type OutgoingSignal = DepositSignal;  // Can only emit DepositSignal variants
///     type Event = DepositEvent;
///     type Error = DSMError;
///
///     fn process_event(&mut self, event: Self::Event)
///         -> Result<SMOutput<Self::Duty, Self::OutgoingSignal>, Self::Error>
///     {
///         // Implementation
///     }
/// }
/// ```
