//! # Bridge Proof Crate (Deprecated)
//!
//! **This crate is deprecated and should not be used in new development.**
//!
//! It is retained **only for reference** and will be **removed once the Glock-based bridge proof
//! system is implemented and validated.**
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Historically, this crate provided the functionality needed to prove inclusion and validity of
//! specific Bitcoin transactions for the Strata rollup bridge. It included data structures and
//! logic to:
//!
//! - Verify sequences of Bitcoin block headers and their corresponding transactions.
//! - Validate Strata rollup checkpoints via zero-knowledge proofs.
//! - Prove deposits, claims, and withdrawals between Bitcoin and the Strata rollup.
//!
//! With the transition to the Glock-based bridge proof architecture, this implementation is now
//! obsolete and preserved solely for reference during the migration.
