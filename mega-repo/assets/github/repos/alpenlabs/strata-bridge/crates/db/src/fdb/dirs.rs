//! This FoundationDB layer is based on top of the standard FoundationDB
//! Directory layer.
//!
//! See:
//! - <https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#directories>
//! - <https://docs.rs/foundationdb/latest/foundationdb/directory/index.html>
//!
//! This is effectively the standard method to do keyspaces/subspaces in the
//! logical Unix-style hierarchical way. Each directory has an associated
//! subspace used to store its content. The directory layer maps each path to a
//! short prefix used for the corresponding subspace. In effect, directories
//! provide a level of indirection for access to subspaces. Directory operations
//! are transactional.
//!
//! The root directory name is configurable (defaulting to "strata-bridge-v1").
//! This allows multiple bridge deployments to share the same FDB cluster if
//! needed, and provides a versioning mechanism for future schema migrations.
//!
//! Within this directory, we have different subspaces for different purposes.
//! Generally, you can imagine these subspaces as similar to tables in a relational
//! database.
//!
//! Note that there is no automatic indexing in FoundationDB. If you want to
//! efficiently query data using fields other than a primary key, you will need
//! to create your own indexes. Since FDB is transactional, you can and SHOULD
//! update the index in the same transaction as the data itself - maintaining
//! consistency.
//!
//! Subspaces and directories should be mostly created once then reused as they
//! require database transactions to create or open.
