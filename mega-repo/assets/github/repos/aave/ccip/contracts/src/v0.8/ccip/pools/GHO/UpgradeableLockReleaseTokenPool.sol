/// @notice Upgradeable version of Chainlink's CCIP LockReleaseTokenPool
/// @dev Contract adaptations:
/// - Implementation of Initializable to allow upgrades
/// - Move of allowlist and router definition to initialization stage
/// - Addition of a bridge limit to regulate the maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred out (burned/locked)
/// - Addition of authorized function to update amount of tokens that are currently bridged
/// - Modifications from inherited contract (see contract for more details):
///    - UpgradeableTokenPool
///       - Remove i_token decimal check in constructor
///       - Add storage `__gap` for future upgrades.
