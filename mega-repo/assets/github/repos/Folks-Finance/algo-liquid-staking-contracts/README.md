# algo-liquid-staking-contracts

## Overview

This repository contains the PyTeal implementation for the Folks Finance ALGO Liquid Staking protocol.

Please refer to the [protocol design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQYGz5NOJO1UWUzyLxPmpCF3dQf7ePeGnT9oXPaS8p0/edit?usp=sharing) for a comprehensive report on the design and implementation details of the protocol.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- Algorand node with `goal` CLI tool (see [installation guide](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/))

## Setup

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Smart Contracts

The `contracts` folder contains the following:

- `contracts/common` contains common checks, inner transactions and a math library.
- `contracts/testing` contains all the smart contracts relating to testing. These are not deployed.
- `contracts/xalgo` contains all the smart contracts relating to the newest version of ALGO Liquid Staking. These will be deployed.

## Testing

Make sure port 8080 is free as the private network setup for testing will use this port.

Run all tests from root directory using:

```bash
npm run test
```

or single test file using:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="./contracts" npx jest <PATH_TO_TEST_FILE>
```

Each test file creates a private network in dev mode, sequentially submits transactions to it, and then tears it down. Therefore it is not possible to run the tests in parallel so `--runInBand` option is passed. Port 8080 must be available for the private network to use.
