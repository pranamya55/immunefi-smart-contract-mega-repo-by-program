/// @title WBERA Staker Vault
/// @author Berachain Team
/// @notice The WBERAStakerVault is an ERC4626-compliant vault that allows users to stake $BERA and earn yield from
/// redirected PoL incentives. This contract is the core component of the PoL BERA Yield Module.
/// Key features:
/// - ERC4626 Compliance: Standard vault interface for easy integration
/// - Native BERA Support: Accepts both native BERA and WBERA deposits
/// - 7-Day Unbonding: Withdrawal requests require 7-day cooldown period
/// - Auto-Compounding: Rewards automatically compound to staker positions
/// - Inflation Attack Protection: Initial deposit mechanism prevents attacks
/// - Emergency Controls: Pausable with role-based access control
/// @dev Contract overrides internal `_withdraw` to enforce cooldown mechanism, all withdraw/redeem call be stored as
/// withdrawal request and can be completed after cooldown period.
/// @dev Contract uses `queueWithdraw` and `queueRedeem` to enqueue withdrawal requests which works with ERC721
/// withdrawal requests.
/// @dev `completeWithdrawal(bool)` is used to support the legacy withdrawal requests while `completeWithdrawal(bool,
/// uint256)` is used to support the ERC721 withdrawal requests.
/// @dev Uses ERC721Enumerable to manage ERC721 withdrawal requests.
/// @dev Only one withdrawal request is allowed per caller until it is completed.
