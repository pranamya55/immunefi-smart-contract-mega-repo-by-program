## BelongCheckIn

Coordinates venue deposits, customer check-ins, and promoter settlements for the Belong program.
@dev
- Maintains venue and promoter balances as denominated ERC1155 credits (1 credit == 1 USD unit).
- Delegates token custody to {Escrow} while enforcing platform fees, referral incentives, and staking perks.
- Prices and swaps LONG through a configured Uniswap V3 router/quoter pairing and a Chainlink price feed.
- Applies staking-tier-dependent deposit fees, customer discounts, and promoter fee splits.
- Streams platform revenue through a buyback-and-burn routine before forwarding the remainder to Factory.platformAddress.
- All externally triggered flows require EIP-712 signatures produced by the platform signer held in {Factory}.

Handles a venue USDC deposit, accounting for fee exemptions, affiliate rewards, and escrow funding.
@dev

- Tracks “free deposit” credits; the platform fee is skipped until the configured allowance is exhausted.
- Charges convenience plus affiliate fees in USDC, swaps them to LONG where applicable, and records the resulting LONG in escrow.
- Applies the buyback/burn split to the platform fee portion before forwarding the remainder to the fee collector.
- Forwards the full venue deposit to {Escrow} and mints venue credits to mirror the USD balance.

Processes a customer payment to a venue, optionally attributing promoter rewards.
@dev
- Signature-validated via platform signer from `Factory`.
- Burns venue credits / mints promoter credits when a promoter participates in the visit.
- USDC payments move USDC directly from customer to venue.
