# Solidity API

## Staking

ERC4626-compatible staking vault for the LONG token with time-locks,
        proportional reward distribution via deposits (rebase effect),
        and an emergency withdrawal path with a configurable penalty.
@dev
- Uses share-based locks to remain correct under reward top-ups that change the exchange rate.
- Emergency flow burns shares and pays out `assets - penalty`, transferring penalty to `treasury`.
- Owner can configure the minimum stake period and penalty percentage.
- Underlying asset address is returned by {asset()} and is immutable after construction.

### MinStakePeriodShouldBeGreaterThanZero

```solidity
error MinStakePeriodShouldBeGreaterThanZero()
```

### MinStakePeriodNotMet

```solidity
error MinStakePeriodNotMet()
```

Reverts when a withdrawal is attempted but locked shares remain.

### PenaltyTooHigh

```solidity
error PenaltyTooHigh()
```

Reverts when the penalty percentage exceeds the scaling factor (100%).
