//! # Timelock Module
//!
//! This module provides functionality for time-delayed execution of operations,
//! enabling governance mechanisms where actions must wait for a minimum delay
//! before execution.
//!
//! The timelock enforces a delay between scheduling an operation and executing
//! it, giving stakeholders time to review and potentially cancel dangerous
//! operations.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! - **Operations**: Actions to be executed on target contracts
//! - **Scheduling**: Proposing an operation with a delay period
//! - **Execution**: Running the operation after the delay has passed
//! - **Cancellation**: Removing a scheduled operation before execution
//! - **Predecessors**: Dependencies between operations (operation B requires
//!   operation A to be done first)
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module provides storage functions that can be integrated into a
//! contract. The contract is responsible for:
//! - Authorization checks (who can schedule/execute/cancel)
//! - Initialization of minimum delay
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use stellar_governance::timelock::{
//!     schedule_operation, execute_operation, get_operation_state, OperationState
//! };
//!
//! // In the contract:
//! pub fn schedule(e: &Env, operation: Operation, delay: u32) {
//!     // Add authorization checks here
//!     let id = schedule_operation(e, &operation, delay);
//!     // Emit events
//! }
//!
//! pub fn execute(e: &Env, operation: Operation) {
//!     // Add authorization checks here
//!     execute_operation(e, &operation);
//!     // Emit events
//! }
//! ```
