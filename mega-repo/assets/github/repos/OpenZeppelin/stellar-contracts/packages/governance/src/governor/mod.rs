//! # Governor Module
//!
//! Implements on-chain governance functionality for Soroban contracts.
//!
//! This module provides the core governance primitives for decentralized
//! decision-making, including proposal creation, voting, counting, and
//! execution.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! The [`Governor`] trait includes:
//!
//! - Proposal lifecycle management (creation, voting, execution, cancellation)
//! - Vote counting and quorum logic (simple counting by default)
//!
//! The default counting implementation provides **simple counting**:
//!
//! - **Vote types**: Against (0), For (1), Abstain (2)
//! - **Vote success**: `for` votes strictly exceed `against` votes
//! - **Quorum**: Sum of `for` and `abstain` votes meets or exceeds the single
//!   configured quorum value (shared across all proposal tallies)
//!
//! The [`Governor`] trait does not define how to store, manage, and access
//! votes. But Governor trait needs to be able to access the voting power of
//! an account at a specific ledger. [`crate::votes::Votes`] trait is expected
//! to be implemented on a token contract, and the governor contract (which
//! implements [`Governor`] trait) is expected to call the
//! [`crate::votes::Votes`] trait methods on the token contract to access the
//! voting power of an account.
//!
//! The following optional extensions are available:
//!
//! - *GovernorSettings* provides configurable parameters like voting delay,
//!   voting period, and proposal threshold.
//! - *TimelockControl* enables the optional `Queue` step in execution. It
//!   integrates the Governor Contract with the Timelock Contract for delayed
//!   execution (queue step before execute).
//!
//! ## Governance Flow
//!
//! 1. **Propose**: A user with sufficient voting power creates a proposal
//! 2. **Vote**: Token holders vote during the voting period
//! 3. **Execute**: Successful proposals (meeting quorum and vote thresholds)
//!    can be executed
//! 4. **Cancel**: Proposals can be canceled by the proposer unless they are
//!    already Executed, Expired, or Cancelled.
//!
//! When using an extension for `Queue` mechanism, like `TimelockControl`, an
//! additional `Queue` step is added between voting and execution:
//!
//! 1. **Propose** → 2. **Vote** → 3. **Queue** → 4. **Execute**
//!
//! To enable queuing, override [`Governor::proposal_needs_queuing`] to return
//! `true`. That single change is sufficient to wire up the full queuing flow:
//! [`storage::execute`] will then require the proposal to be in the `Queued`
//! state instead of `Succeeded` before executing. For further customization
//! (e.g. custom delay enforcement), override [`Governor::execute`] as well.
//!
//! # Security Considerations
//!
//! ## Flash Loan Voting Attack
//!
//! ### Vulnerability Overview
//!
//! Governance systems are vulnerable to flash loan attacks where an attacker
//! borrows a large amount of voting tokens, votes on a proposal, and returns
//! the tokens within the same transaction.
//!
//! ### Mitigation
//!
//! This implementation uses **snapshot-based voting power**. When a proposal
//! is created, the current ledger number is recorded as the "snapshot". All
//! voting power calculations use
//! [`crate::votes::Votes::get_votes_at_checkpoint()`] which queries the voting
//! power at the snapshot ledger, not the current ledger.
//!
//! This means an attacker must hold tokens *before* a proposal is created
//! to have voting power on that proposal, making flash loan attacks
//! ineffective.
//!
//! ## Proposal Spam Attack
//!
//! ### Vulnerability Overview
//!
//! An attacker could create many proposals to overwhelm governance
//! participants, making it difficult to focus on legitimate proposals.
//!
//! ### Mitigation
//!
//! The **proposal threshold** ([`get_proposal_threshold()`]) requires
//! proposers to hold a minimum amount of voting power to create proposals.
//! This makes spam attacks economically costly.
//!
//! ## Governance Capture
//!
//! ### Vulnerability Overview
//!
//! An attacker could accumulate voting power over time to eventually control
//! governance decisions.
//!
//! ### Mitigation
//!
//! - **Quorum requirements** ensure a minimum percentage of total voting supply
//!   participates in each proposal
//! - **Voting delay** ([`get_voting_delay()`]) gives token holders time to
//!   acquire more tokens or delegate before voting starts
