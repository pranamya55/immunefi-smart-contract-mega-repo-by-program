//! # Votes Module
//!
//! This module provides utilities for tracking voting power per account with
//! historical checkpoints. It supports delegation (an account can delegate its
//! voting power to another account) and provides historical vote queries at any
//! past ledger sequence number.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! - **Voting Units**: The base unit of voting power, typically 1:1 with token
//!   balance
//! - **Delegation**: Accounts can delegate their voting power to another
//!   account (delegatee). **Only delegated voting power counts as votes** while
//!   undelegated voting units are not counted. Self-delegation is required for
//!   an account to use its own voting power.
//! - **Checkpoints**: Historical snapshots of voting power at specific ledger
//!   sequence numbers
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module is to be integrated into a token contract and is responsible
//! for:
//! - Overriding the transfer method to call `transfer_voting_units` on every
//!   balance change (mint/burn/transfer), as shown in the example below
//! - Exposing delegation functionality to users
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use stellar_governance::votes::{
//!     delegate, get_votes, get_votes_at_checkpoint, transfer_voting_units,
//! };
//!
//! // Override the token contract's transfer to update voting units:
//! pub fn transfer(e: &Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
//!     // ... perform transfer logic ...
//!     transfer_voting_units(e, Some(&from), Some(&to), amount as u128);
//! }
//!
//! // Expose delegation:
//! pub fn delegate(e: &Env, account: Address, delegatee: Address) {
//!     votes::delegate(e, &account, &delegatee);
//! }
//! ```
