# Fee Abstraction

Utilities for implementing fee abstraction (fee forwarding) for interacting with Soroban contracts, allowing users to pay transaction fees in tokens (e.g., USDC) instead of native XLM.

## Overview

Fee abstraction enables a better UX by letting users pay for transactions with tokens they already hold. Another actor, called relayer, covers the XLM network fees and is compensated in the user's chosen token. 

The flow involves an off-chain negotiation between the user and a relayer (quote request, fee agreement), but the actual execution happens through an intermediary contract called **FeeForwarder**. This contract enforces that the user is charged at most `max_fee_amount` (the cap they signed). The relayer determines the actual `fee_amount` at submission time based on network conditions, but can never exceed the user's authorized maximum.

    User->>Relayer: 2. Request quote (fee token, expiration, target)
    Relayer-->>User: Quote: max_fee_amount
    
    User->>User: 3. Sign authorization for FeeForwarder.forward()<br/>including subinvocations for:<br/> Token.approve() and Target.target_fn()
    User->>Relayer: 4. Hand over signed authorization entry
    
    Relayer->>Relayer: 5. Verify params satisfy requirements<br/>(fee amount, token, fee recipient, ...)
    Relayer->>Relayer: 6. Sign as source_account
    Relayer->>FeeForwarder: 7. Execute forward():<br/>submit a tx and pay XLM fees
    
    FeeForwarder->>FeeForwarder: 8. Validate authorizations
    FeeForwarder->>Token: 9. Approve max fee amount (optional)
    FeeForwarder->>Token: 10. Transfer fee amount to fee recipient
    FeeForwarder->>Target Contract: 11. Invoke target_fn(target_args)
    Target Contract-->>User: Result
```

## Features

- Fee Collection Helpers (eager and lazy approval strategies)
- Invoker Helper handling user-side authorizations
- Optional Fee Token Allowlist
- Optional Token Sweeping (fees are collected on the forwarding contract and transferred later on)
- Validation Utilities

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# We recommend pinning to a specific version, because rapid iterations are expected as the library is in an active development phase.
stellar-fee-abstraction = "=0.6.0"
```

### Examples

- [fee-forwarder-permissioned](../../examples/fee-forwarder-permissioned)

  - Only trusted executors can call `forward`.
  - The forwarder contract itself collects the fees, which can be swept later.

- [fee-forwarder-permissionless](../../examples/fee-forwarder-permissionless)
  - Anyone can call `forward`; there is no executor allowlist.
  - The relayer (transaction submitter) receives the collected fee.
