//! # Fee Abstraction Module
//!
//! This module provides utilities for implementing fee abstraction in Stellar
//! contracts, allowing users to pay transaction fees in tokens instead of
//! native XLM.
//!
//! # Core Features
//!
//! - **Target invocation and fee collection** helper
//! - **Fee Token Allowlist**: Optional allowlist for accepted fee tokens
//! - **Token Sweeping**: Optional functions to collect accumulated fees
//! - **Fee Validation**: Utilities for validating fee amounts
//! - **Approval strategies**: utilities for collecting fee from users support
//!   two approval semantics:
//!   - [`FeeAbstractionApproval::Eager`]: always approve `max_fee_amount`
//!     (overwriting any existing allowance)
//!   - [`FeeAbstractionApproval::Lazy`]: only approve if the current allowance
//!     is less than `max_fee_amount`
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module provides storage functions and event helpers that can be
//! integrated into a fee forwarding contract. The implementing contract is
//! responsible for the authorization checks and who can manage fee tokens or
//! sweep collected fees.
