/// # Inflation Attack (Donation Attack) Mitigation
///
/// ## Vulnerability Overview
///
/// In empty (or nearly empty) vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen
/// through a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share.
/// This is variously known as a **donation attack** or **inflation attack** and
/// is essentially a problem of slippage.
///
/// ## Attack Mechanism
///
/// 1. Attacker observes a pending deposit transaction in the mempool
/// 2. Attacker frontruns by directly transferring assets to the vault
///    (donation)
/// 3. This inflates the share price before the victim's deposit is processed
/// 4. Victim receives fewer shares than expected due to inflated price
/// 5. Attacker redeems their shares, capturing value from the victim's deposit
///
/// ## Mitigation Strategies
///
/// ### 1. Initial Deposit Protection
///
/// Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial deposit
/// of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes
/// infeasible. This "dead shares" approach makes the attack economically
/// unviable.
///
/// ### 2. Virtual Assets and Shares (Configurable Decimals Offset)
///
/// This implementation introduces configurable virtual assets and shares to
/// help developers mitigate the risk. The decimals offset (accessible via
/// [`Vault::get_decimals_offset()`]) corresponds to an offset in the decimal
/// representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault
/// decimals.
///
/// While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default
/// offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture
/// value from multiple user deposits, as a result of the value being captured
/// by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's donation) matching the
/// attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders
/// of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable.
///
/// The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very
/// small) part of the value being accrued to the vault. Also, if the vault
/// experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and
/// assets will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in
/// detriment to the last users that will experience bigger losses.
///
/// If this is not the preferred solution, implementers can still use the
/// default offset of 0 and implement their own safeguards.
///
