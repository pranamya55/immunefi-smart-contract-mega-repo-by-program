/// Enumerable Trait for Non-Fungible Token
///
/// The `NonFungibleEnumerable` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to
/// provide the following:
/// * Enumerating the tokens of an account.
/// * Enumerating all the tokens in the smart contract.
///
/// Enumerating all the tokens of an account is achieved via the help of the
/// [`crate::non_fungible::NonFungibleToken::balance()`] function. `Enumerable`
/// extension stores a list of the tokens of an owner, with indices. Every
/// owner's list starts with the local index `0`, and the last token of the
/// owner can be found with `balance() - 1`. To retrieve the `token_id`s, one
/// can call the [`NonFungibleEnumerable::get_owner_token_id()`] function.
///
/// Enumerating all the tokens in the smart contract is achieved via the help
/// of the [`NonFungibleEnumerable::total_supply()`] function. `Enumerable`
/// extension stores a list of all the tokens, with indices. The first token of
/// the contract can be found with `index` `0`, the second with `1`, and so on.
/// To retrieve `token_id`s, one can call the
/// [`NonFungibleEnumerable::get_token_id()`] function.
///
/// This trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `NonFungibleToken`
/// trait.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// 1. The `Enumerable` trait has its own business logic for creating and
///    destroying tokens. Therefore, this trait is INCOMPATIBLE with the
///    `Consecutive` extension.
/// 2. Enumerability can also be offloaded to off-chain services. This extension
///    exists for the use-cases where the enumeration is required as an on-chain
///    operation.
