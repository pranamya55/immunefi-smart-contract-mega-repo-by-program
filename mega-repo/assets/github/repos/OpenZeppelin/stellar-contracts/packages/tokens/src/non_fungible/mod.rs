//! # Non-Fungible Token Contract Module.
//!
//! Implements utilities for handling non-fungible tokens in a Soroban contract.
//!
//! This module provides essential storage functionalities required for managing
//! balances, approvals, and transfers of non-fungible tokens.
//!
//! ## Design Overview
//!
//! This module is structured to provide flexibility by splitting
//! functionalities into higher-level and lower-level operations:
//!
//! - **High-Level Functions**: These include all necessary checks,
//!   verifications, authorizations, state-changing logic, and event emissions.
//!   They simplify usage by handling core logic securely. These functions can
//!   be called directly for typical token operations without exposing
//!   implementation details.
//!
//! - **Low-Level Functions**: These offer granular control when custom
//!   workflows must be composed. Such functions expose internal mechanisms and
//!   require the caller to handle verifications and authorizations manually.
//!
//! This dual-layered approach provides a choice between convenience and
//! customization, depending on project requirements.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! The base module includes:
//!
//! - Transfers
//! - Owner and Approval management
//! - Metadata management (`name`, `symbol`, and `token_uri`)
//!
//! The following optional extensions are available:
//!
//! - *Burnable* enables token holders to destroy their non-fungible tokens.
//! - *Enumerable* allows for enumeration of all the token IDs in the contract
//!   as well as all the token IDs owned by each account.
//! - *Consecutive* is useful for efficiently minting multiple tokens in a
//!   single transaction.
//!
//! ## Compatibility and Compliance
//!
//! The ERC-721 interface is adapted to Stellar Ecosystem, facilitating
//! cross-ecosystem familiarity and ease of use, with the following differences:
//!
//! - `transfer()` function is made available due to consistency with Fungible
//!   Token interface, and also it is a simpler (thus, cheaper and faster)
//!   version of `transferFrom()`, which may become handy depending on the
//!   context.
//! - `safeTransfer` mechanism is not present in the base module, (will be
//!   provided as an extension)
//! - `name()`, `symbol()` and `token_uri()` functionalities are made available
//!   to be consistent with fungible tokens as well.
//!
//!
//! ## Notes for Developers
//!
//! - **Security Considerations**: While high-level functions handle necessary
//!   checks, users of low-level functions must take extra care to ensure
//!   correctness and security.
//! - **Composable Design**: The modular structure encourages developers to
//!   extend functionality by combining provided primitives or creating custom
//!   extensions.

/// Vanilla NonFungible Token Trait
///
/// The `NonFungibleToken` trait defines the core functionality for non-fungible
/// tokens. It provides a standard interface for managing
/// transfers and approvals associated with non-fungible tokens.
///
/// Event for `mint` is defined, but `mint` function itself is not included
/// as a method in this trait because it is not a part of the standard,
/// the function signature may change depending on the implementation.
///
/// Functions are provided for both sequential minting
/// ([`crate::non_fungible::Base::sequential_mint`]) and non-sequential
/// minting strategies ([`crate::non_fungible::Base::mint`]).
///
/// This trait is implemented for the following Contract Types:
/// * [`crate::non_fungible::Base`] (covering the vanilla case, and compatible
///   with [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`])
///   trait
/// * [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::enumerable::Enumerable`] (enabling the
///   compatibility and overrides for
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::enumerable::NonFungibleEnumerable`])
///   trait, incompatible with
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`]) and
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::consecutive::NonFungibleConsecutive`]
///   trait.
/// * [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::consecutive::Consecutive`] (enabling
///   the compatibility and overrides for
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::consecutive::NonFungibleConsecutive`])
///   trait, incompatible with
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`]) and
///   [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::enumerable::NonFungibleEnumerable`]
///   trait.
///
/// The default implementations of this trait for `Base`, `Enumerable`, and
/// `Consecutive` can be found by navigating to `ContractType::{method_name}`.
/// For example, the implementation of [`NonFungibleToken::transfer`] for the
/// `Enumerable` contract type can be found at
/// [`crate::non_fungible::extensions::enumerable::Enumerable::transfer`].
