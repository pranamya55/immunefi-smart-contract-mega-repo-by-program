/// Trait for managing token bindings to periphery contracts.
///
/// The `TokenBinder` trait provides a standardized interface for linking tokens
/// to periphery contracts requiring this, such as:
/// - Identity Storage Registry
/// - Compliance contracts
///
/// This binding mechanism allows tokens to be associated with regulatory and
/// compliance infrastructure, enabling features like identity verification,
/// compliance checking, and claim validation.
///
/// # Storage Pattern
///
/// The underlying storage uses an enumerable pattern for efficiency:
/// - Tokens are indexed sequentially (0, 1, 2, ...)
/// - Swap-remove pattern maintains compact storage when unbinding
///
/// Note that the storage module also exposes a batch binding helper
/// `bind_tokens(e, tokens)` which is not part of this trait, so that client
/// contracts can decide how to expose batch semantics in their own interfaces.
///
/// Implementation notes:
/// - Token addresses are stored in buckets of 100 addresses each (`BUCKET_SIZE
///   = 100`).
/// - Up to 100 buckets are supported (`MAX_BUCKETS = 100`), allowing at most
///   10,000 tokens bound to a single contract.
/// - With Protocol 23, reading live Soroban state is inexpensive and read-entry
///   limits per transaction have been removed. Lookups are therefore cheap, and
///   storage remains simple with no reverse mapping; functions like
///   `get_token_index()` linearly scan buckets.
