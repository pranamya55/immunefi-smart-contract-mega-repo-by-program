//! # Real World Asset (RWA) Token Contract Module
//!
//! Implements utilities for handling Real World Asset tokens in a Soroban
//! contract. This module is based on the T-REX (Token for Regulated Exchanges)
//! standard, providing comprehensive functionality for compliant security
//! tokens.
//!
//! ## Design Overview
//!
//! RWA tokens are security tokens that represent real-world assets and must
//! comply with various regulations. This module provides:
//!
//! - **Identity Management**: Integration with identity registries for KYC/AML
//! - **Compliance Framework**: Modular compliance rules and validation
//! - **Transfer Controls**: Sophisticated transfer restrictions and validations
//! - **Token Lifecycle**: Minting, burning, freezing, and recovery mechanisms
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in support for compliance rules and
//!   identity verification
//! - **Freezing Mechanisms**: Address-level and partial token freezing
//!   capabilities
//! - **Recovery System**: Lost/old account recovery for verified investors
//! - **Pausable Operations**: Emergency pause functionality for the entire
//!   token
//! - **RBAC**: Role-based access control allows to define and set custom
//!   privileges for the administrative functions based on the needs of the
//!   token/project.
//!
//! ## Flexibility
//!
//! RWA Token contract is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing
//! for easy integration with variety of identity registry and compliance
//! frameworks (i.e. Merkle-Tree or Zero-Knowledge based identity
//! registries, etc.). This flexibility is achieved by the architecture
//! and loose-coupling between the modules and the token contract.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The main RWA contract denoted by [`RWAToken`] interface, is expecting two
//! modules to be available from external contracts:
//!
//! ### Compliance Module:
//! - `fn can_transfer(e: &Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128, token:
//!   Address) -> bool;`
//! - `fn can_create(e: &Env, to: Address, amount: i128, token: Address) ->
//!   bool;`
//! - `fn created(e: &Env, to: Address, amount: i128, token: Address);`
//! - `fn destroyed(e: &Env, from: Address, amount: i128, token: Address);`
//! - `fn transferred(e: &Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128, token:
//!   Address);`
//!
//! ### Identity Verifier Module:
//! - `fn verify_identity(e: &Env, account: &Address);`
//!
//! Hence, the [`RWAToken`] interface also exposes the following functions to
//! set and get the necessary contracts:
//!
//! Compliance:
//! - `set_compliance(e: &Env, compliance: Address, operator: Address)`
//! - `compliance(e: &Env) -> Address`
//!
//! Identity Verifier:
//! - `set_identity_verifier(e: &Env, identity_verifier: Address, operator:
//!   Address)`
//! - `identity_verifier(e: &Env) -> Address`
//!
//! As long as these two modules and the mentioned functions are available to
//! the RWA Token contract, the [`RWAToken`] interface can be used to create a
//! compliant RWA token.
//!
//! The above mentioned functions are deliberately marked as implementation
//! details, to provide flexibility and allow for alternate approaches for
//! different business needs.
//!
//! The concrete implementation for these functions can be found in the modules
//! below. These modules act as the default implementations for the most common
//! needs.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - **Identity Verification**: Claim issuers, claim topic registries, identity
//!   claims, identity registry storage, and the identity verifier contract
//! - **Compliance**: Core compliance contract and its pluggable compliance
//!   modules
//! - **Extensions**: Optional extensions providing additional functionality
//!   like document management
