//! Permissionless fee forwarder example.
//!
//! This example shows how to integrate the `stellar-fee-abstraction` helpers in
//! a **permissionless** setup:
//!
//! - **Anyone** can call the `forward` entrypoint; there is no executor
//!   allowlist.
//! - The **relayer** (the transaction submitter) receives the collected fee.
//!
//! In contrast, the permissioned example restricts `forward` to trusted
//! executors and has the contract itself collect fees. This pattern is suitable
//! for open environments where any party can become a relayer and be
//! economically incentivized to forward user transactions.
