//! Fee Forwarder Contract
//!
//! This contract enables fee abstraction by allowing users to pay relayers in
//! tokens instead of native XLM. The contract accepts token payment and
//! forwards calls to target contracts, ensuring atomic execution.
//!
//! ## Flow Overview
//!
//! 1. **User prepares transaction** (off-chain):
//!    - User wants to call `target_contract.target_fn(target_args)`
//!    - User wants to pay the transaction fees with tokens different than XLM
//!      (e.g., USDC)
//!    - User gets a quote from relayer: max fee amount and expiration ledger
//!
//! 2. **User signs authorization** (first signature):
//!    - User authorizes the fee-forwarder contract with these parameters:
//!      - `fee_token`: Which token to use for payment
//!      - `max_fee_amount`: Maximum fee they're willing to pay
//!      - `expiration_ledger`: When the authorization expires
//!      - `target_contract`, `target_fn`, `target_args`: The actual call to
//!        make
//!    - User MUST include at least one subinvocation:
//!      - `fee_token.approve(fee_forwarder, max_fee_amount, expiration_ledger)`
//!    - Depending on the target contract call, user may need to include a
//!      second subinvocation:
//!      - `target_contract.target_fn(target_args)` (if it requires some
//!        authorization)
//!
//!    **Note**:
//!    - User does NOT sign the exact `fee_amount` or `relayer` address yet
//!      (these are unknown at signing time)
//!
//! 3. **Relayer picks up transaction** (off-chain):
//!    - Relayer calculates actual `fee_amount` based on current network
//!      conditions
//!
//! 4. **Relayer signs authorization** (second signature):
//!    - Relayer authorizes the fee-forwarder contract
//!    - Relayer must have `executor` role to call `forward()`
//!
//! 5. **Relayer submits transaction**:
//!    - Relayer pays native XLM fees for network inclusion
//!    - Transaction contains call to `fee_forwarder.forward()` with both
//!      authorizations
//!
//! 6. **Contract executes atomically**:
//!    - Validates both user and relayer authorizations
//!    - User approves contract to spend up to `max_fee_amount` tokens
//!    - Contract transfers exactly `fee_amount` tokens from user to itself
//!    - Contract forwards call to `target_contract.target_fn(target_args)`
//!    - If any step fails, entire transaction reverts (including token
//!      transfer)
